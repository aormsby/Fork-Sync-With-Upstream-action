# Github Action: Upstream Sync

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action)

An action with forks in mind! Automatically sync a branch on your fork with the latest commits from the original repo. Keep things up to date!

**Bonus:** This action can also sync between branches on any two repositories. So you have options. :slightly_smiling_face:

**\*\*FIXED in v3.3:\*\***
- Changed variable name to match the docs -- INPUT_TARGET_PUSH_ARGS ---> INPUT_TARGET_BRANCH_PUSH_ARGS
- Output for `has_new_commits` is now properly set if fetching from upstream results in error

## Intended Workflow

This action was made to keep **non-working** branches up to date with a remote repo. However, you can probably use it for active work branches as well if the custom input supports your needs. Here's how it works.

You have a branch on your `target` repo - the one you want to update - and a branch on your `upstream` repo - where the updates are coming from. This action checks out those branches on both repos, checks for any new commits (by hash comparison), and pulls those new commits from upstream. Easy!

As stated, this works best if your target branch is a non-working branch - i.e. you don't make any commits to it. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action/wiki/Scenarios-for-Advanced-Input) for notes on how to use input vars for specific situations.

## How to Use

[Add a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow) to your repo that includes this action ([sample below](#sample-workflow)). Please note that scheduled workflows only run on the default branch of a repo.

### Input Variables

**Note:** For clarity reasons, some variable names have been changed between v2 and v3. Please check your workflows for the correct input.

#### Core Use

| Name                       |     Required?      | Default | Example                                  |
| -------------------------- | :----------------: | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| target_sync_branch         | :white_check_mark: |         | 'master', 'main', 'my-branch'            |
| target_repo_token          | :white_check_mark: |         | ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}              |
| upstream_repo_access_token |                    |         | ${{ secrets.NAME_OF_TOKEN }}             |
| upstream_sync_repo         | :white_check_mark: |         | 'aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action' |
| upstream_sync_branch       | :white_check_mark: |         | 'master', 'main', 'my-branch'            |
| test_mode                  |                    | false   | true / false                             |

**Always** set `target_repo_token` to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` so the action can push to your target repo. ([wiki](https://github.com/aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action/wiki/Configuration#setup-notes))

This action supports syncing from both public and private upstream repos. Store an authentication token in your target repo and use `github_token: ${{ secrets.NAME_OF_TOKEN }}` as an input var for the action to access your private upstream repo.

#### Advanced Use (all optional args)

| Name                        |     Required?      | Default                     | Example                             |
| --------------------------- | :----------------: | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| host_domain                 | :white_check_mark: | 'github.com'                | 'github.com'                        |
| shallow_since               | :white_check_mark: | '1 month ago'               | '2 days ago', '3 weeks 7 hours ago' |
| target_branch_checkout_args |                    |                             | '--recurse-submodules'              |
| git_log_format_args         |                    | '--pretty=oneline'          | '--graph --pretty=oneline'          |
| upstream_pull_args          |                    |                             | '--ff-only --tags'                  |
| target_branch_push_args     |                    |                             | '--force'                           |
| git_config_user             |                    | 'GH Action - Upstream Sync' |                                     |
| git_config_email            |                    | 'action@github.com'         |                                     |
| git_config_pull_rebase      |                    | 'false'                     |                                     |

`shallow_since` -> Value should match the time between workflow runs to get the history depth required (but no more) for a good check of new commits to sync

##### Git Config Settings

Some basic git config settings must be in place to pull and push data during the action. As seen above, these inputs are required and have default values. They are reset when this action step is finished.

**Set any git config values to `null` to skip their configuration during this action step.**

### Output Variables

| Name            | Output     | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| has_new_commits | true/false | Outputs true if new commits were found in the remote repo, false if target repo already has the latest updates. |

    - name: New commits found
      if: steps.sync.outputs.has_new_commits == 'true'
      run: echo "New commits were found to sync."
    
    - name: No new commits
      if: steps.sync.outputs.has_new_commits == 'false'
      run: echo "There were no new commits."
      
    - name: Show value of 'has_new_commits'
